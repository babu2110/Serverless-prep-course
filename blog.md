## About Me

Hello there! My name is Batbuyan Nyamdavaa. I am an international student here in Chicago, Illinois at UIC. I am currently taking serverless booting camp which will help me to get a better understanding of JavaScript. Hopefully, I can get better at it since I am gonna take UX/UI class in fall. 

and lastly, you guys have a wonderful day.
